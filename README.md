Both gened-dataset-clean.csv and uiuc-tre-dataset-clean.csv are derived from the following two links.

Gened dataset: https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/master/geneds
Excellent Teachers dataset: https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/master/teachers-ranked-as-excellent

gened-dataset clean.csv and uiuc-tre-dataset clean.csv are the files that are cleaned by openrefine.

The main cleanup operations are dealing with invalid data and splitting columns.
